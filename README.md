# Dogs API Data Analysis

## Overview
This project utilizes a free API to retrieve information about various dogs, allowing for an in-depth analysis of two hypotheses:
1. Life Expectancy vs. Size
2. Sexual Dimorphism in Weight

## Usage
1 - Retrieve data from the API using the provided scripts.
2 - Manipulate and analyze the data as described in the Jupyter notebooks or Python scripts.
3 - Explore the results of the analysis, including visualizations for better understanding.

## Usage
1 - Data retrieval from the API
2 - Data cleaning and manipulation
3 - Statistical analysis to explore the hypotheses

## Hypotheses
1 - Life Expectancy vs. Size: This hypothesis investigates the relationship between the size of dogs and their average life expectancy.
2 - Sexual Dimorphism in Weight: This hypothesis examines the differences in weight between male and female dogs.

## Conclusion
The analysis provides insights into the hypotheses, revealing trends and patterns in the data. Further research may delve deeper into additional factors affecting life expectancy and weight.
